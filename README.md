# FL-Datasets-for-HAR

This repo includes four new real-world human activity recognition (HAR) datasets collected under federated learning settings, which first appear at the MobiSys 2021 paper: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458864.3467681"> ClusterFL: A Similarity-Aware Federated Learning System for Human Activity Recognition </a> .

The first dataset is a large-scale dataset collected using an Android App in a crowdsourcing manner. The other three are collected in indoor environments.


# Download

  The four datasets are publicly available in the current repository. Each dataset is accompanied by a Python file "data_pre.py" for preprocessing and loading each node's data separately in federated learning. The data and processing file are compressed to a ".zip" file for each dataset. Please click the following links for more detail descriptions and downloading each dataset.
