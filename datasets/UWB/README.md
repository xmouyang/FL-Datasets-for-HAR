# UWB Dataset: Human Movement Detection using Ultra Wide Band Modules


Human movement can influence the multi-path effect of UWB (Ultra Wide Band) signals, thus introducing significant errors to distance measurement between two UWB nodes. In this dataset, we conduct experiments to detect human movement in 3 different environments (parking lot/corridor/room) using two UWB nodes that measure dis- tance by two-way ranging. The two nodes are placed 3m away from each other, with or without a person walking between them, with a sampling rate of 5Hz. Each data record contains a 10-second long recording of normalized errors (50 dimensions), and five statistical attributes (maximum, minimum, mean, standard deviation, and the number of values equal to the mean). This dataset has a small number of data records, with a low dimension of each record. Moreover, the task of human movement detection using UWB is a simple 2-class classification task.
